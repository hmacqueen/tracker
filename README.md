# tracker
Project to create a simple tracking system to encourage me to keep to a disciplined schedule
Especially useful for right now since no work means no externally imposed schedule

Idea is to create a weekly plan:
- What exercise to do each week and which day to do it on
- With some idea of expected calorie expenditure
- Planned meals 
- With some idea of expected calorie consumption
- Specific personal development objectives (learning objectives)
- House and other non-PD projects for the week
<br>
And then to track:
<ul>
  <li>Exercise (pulled from my Fitbit app)</li>
- Food consumed (ditto)
- Weight (ditto)
- PD achievements
- Other project achievements

There are almost certainly apps on the market (Fitbit, even) that do some of this. 
However this project is in itself part of my PD: learning html, css and python
